# Machine_Learning
This is my ML exploration lab... I am curious to understand how Neural Networks and other algorithms work under the hood and challenge myself to code them up from scratch. So this is where I have been trying things from coding the simplest NN (one neuron) to fully connected deep learning networks and self-organizing maps.  I include some of the original papers from back in the day. I could not include datasets because of their size, but I highly recommend downloading the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets to testing the Multiple Layer Perceptron.
